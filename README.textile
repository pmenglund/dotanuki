h1. Dotanuki "!https://secure.travis-ci.org/pmenglund/dotanuki.png?branch=master!":http://travis-ci.org/pmenglund/dotanuki

Simple but effective executioner of commands, which will deal correctly with failed commands.

h1. Examples

In the following example, if the <code>mkdir</code> fails, none of the other commands will be executed.

<pre>
	class Example
		include Dotanuki

		def test
			commands = [
				"mkdir /tmp/foo",
				"cp /etc/hosts /tmp/foo",
				"cp /etc/passwd /tmp/foo"
			]

			result = execute(commands)
			if result.failed?
				puts "execution failed: #{result.fail_message}"
			end
		end
	end
</pre>

It can also be used with a <code>guard</code> block, which will raise an <code>ExecError</code> if a command fails.

<pre>
	class Example
		include Dotanuki

		def test
			guard do
				execute "mkdir /tmp/foo"
				execute "cp /etc/hosts /tmp/foo"
				execute "cp /etc/passwd /tmp/foo"
			end
		end
	end
</pre>
